# Component Stories

These are "stories" for [react-storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook).

Each describes some states for a component, allowing us to view the
component in the storybook in any of those states. This is useful
during development and manual testing of components.

Run the storybook with `npm run storybook`

Import new stories to the configuration in `<zanata-spa>/.storybook/config.js`
