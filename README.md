## Code Guidelines

### Javascript/Angular

Stick very closely to [these Angular guidelines](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide).

And [these](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for Javascript.

### CSS

For CSS I am aiming to move to [these guidelines](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/README.md).

For now, CSS still lives in [Zanata Assets](https://github.com/zanata/zanata-assets).
